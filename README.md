# ask-ai-python-assignment

At ask-ai, we aggregate text-heavy data from multiple sources, such as external help-centers, internal documentation,
and customer communications using NLP models. The first step in this process is to query and store this data.

In this task, you are required to create a server that is able to validate access and index sources.

You are provided with the following APIs:
A mock API to query two sources (Google Docs and Salesforce Knowledge Base) and a mock API to load and save files to the
cloud.
